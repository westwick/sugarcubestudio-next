  simurghAboutText: "In Simurgh, the legendary guardian of Iran is awakening to help us take Iran back. This side-scrolling beat 'em up from Sugar Cube Studio blends ancient majesty with the raw spirit of modern resistance, following Anahita as she fights for survival through the beautiful ruins of Persepolis. As a barbaric regime threatens to erase our heritage, Anahita is guided by the mythical Simurgh—the benevolent bird of wisdom that has protected the Iranian soul for millennia. By freeing captives, you collect the Simurgh's sacred feathers to invoke the Power of the Immortals, tapping into a 2,500-year-old legacy of Persian Immortals. Under the Simurgh's watchful wings, you will turn the tide against oppression, proving that when the people rise as one, the heart of Iran is reborn. Download and play today!",
